# Library Resources Management System (LRMS)

## Important Notice:

    I'm paused the project because I'm currently taking a course.
    perhaps according to the course result,
    the project can be changed architecturally (most likely). 
    however, the entity structure may not change.

    The main purpose of the project was to highlight the layers of
    "Watcher",
    "Actionist",
    "Platform Resource Manager (PRM)".

## What is LRMS
    
    Library Resources Management System. A huge library that allows libraries everywhere to be used together.

## Ready for the Future

    it is being developed ready for future technologies.
    The future library is ready.

## Why multi-layered architecture

    Scalability. Developerability. Manageability.

## The most advanced

    features that you may not think of will be added.  forever.

## Always Accessible

    Non-stop operability.

## Compliance with the Rules

    the safety of societies is prioritized.

## Open Source Spirit

    It will carry this spirit and be open to developments with this spirit.

## System Structure 

    The system structure is decentralized, simple and based on scalability.

### Entity

    Entities are the counterparts of the Databases tables.
    Abstract,DTOs (Data Transfer Object), concrete layer, base, infos layers in it.

### Dataccess

    The DataAccess tier is the databases access tier.
    The database consists of classes, interfaces, contexts, layers for configuration and access.

### Core

    The core layer is the most important layer.
    is the kernel layer used to aggregate kernel codes, plugins, tools, more.

### Business (Logic)

    The business layer is the logic layer for the API. There may be more

### API

    API layer, not much, it can be

### Watcher
    
    The watcher layer is the core layer that monitors
    each connected layer and monitors the statistics data accordingly.
    what it does is all about watching.

### Actionist

    Actionist is a very important layer that takes action by
    processing the data it receives from the watcher.

### Platform Resource Manager (PRM)

    PRM is the Layer that manages the resources of the platform on which it runs.
